The restrictions are as follows:

Bloacked Characters: { "(", ")",";","'","+","-","*","\n","/","||","{", "}","[","]" } :
Min Length: 2 Characters
Max Lenght: 10 Characters


#About
So as I said I "Made this to help me learn C# and it's kind of cool thought I would share it."
This program allows for you to pick a random word like "Hello" and it will scramble the letters a whole bunch until it randomly scrambles the word back into place.
